[slurmBatch.m]

NOTE:
In order to use slurmBatch.m, you will need to have the shell scripts 
matlab_background and matlab_nojvm in your shell search path. You will also
need to edit matlab_nojvm to point to the network executale for matlab. You
also need to edit the variable <outHome> in slurmBatch.m and slurmLogs.m to a 
common location to store scripts and logs.

[slurmCancel.m] 
Use to cancel jobs running or pending on the queue.

[slurmQuery.m]
Use to query information regarding jobs on the queue.

[slurmLogs.m]
Use to print out current logs and errors for jobs sent to the queue.

ANOTHER NOTE:
You need to have munge running for all of these commands to work. munge can be 
restarted from the shell command line (assuming you have a sudoers account):

	$ sudo service munge restart
