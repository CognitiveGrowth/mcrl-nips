"""Extend HITs as assignments are completed.

If a HIT takes up a lot of bandwidth, then you may only want to have a
few workers doing it at a time. This script monitors how many
assignments are currently being worked on, and as they are completed,
extends the HIT with new assignments until a specified upper limit is
reached.
