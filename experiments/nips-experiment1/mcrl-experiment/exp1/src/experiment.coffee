            There are eight possible final destinations labelled 1-8 in the image below. On your way there, you will visit two intermediate locations. <b>Every location you visit will add or subtract money to your account</b>, and your task is to earn as much money as possible. <b>To find out how much money you earn or lose in a location, you have to click on it.</b> You can uncover the value of as many or as few locations as you wish.
