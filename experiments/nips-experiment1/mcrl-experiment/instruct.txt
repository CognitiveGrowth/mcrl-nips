You will receive feedback about your planning. This feedback
will help you learn how to make better decisions.</b> After each
flight, if you did not plan optimally, a feedback message will
apear. This message will tell you two things: 

1. Whether you observed too few relevant values or if you observed
   irrelevant values (values of locations that you can't fly to).
2. Whether you flew along the best route given your current location and
   the information you had about the values of other locations.

  In the example below, not enough relevant values
  were observed, and as a result there is a 15 second timeout
  penalty. <b>The duration of the timeout penalty is proportional to
  how poorly you planned your route:</b> the more money you could
  have earned from observing more values and/or choosing a better
  route, the longer the delay. The second feedback in the example
  below indicates the plane was flown along the best route, given
  the limited information available. If you perform optimally, no
  feedback will be shown and you can proceed immediately.
